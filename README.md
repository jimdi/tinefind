# tunefind
tunefind parser for TV shows tracklist

just find show in tunefind and get name from url, eg for Breaking Bad we get https://www.tunefind.com/show/breaking-bad that means we use breaking-bad as "showname" argument

./python3 tunefind.py breaking-bad

after process we get breaking-bad.md in result folder

use --no-cache (--no-c) option to force downloading data again instead using cached data
